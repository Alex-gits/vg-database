## Hello, this is my React.js pet-project. It is a video games database build with [Rawg API](https://rawg.io/apidocs).
You can use my website to check trending games, incoming games, best games and details of some certain game.

It was deployed to Heroku. You can check it [online](https://vg-database.herokuapp.com/) (first visit may take some time).

The app was build with:

### 1. [React.js](https://ru.reactjs.org/)
### 2. [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
### 3. [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
### 4. [Rawg API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)
### 4. React hooks
### 5. Some other small libraries (reselect, persist, etc)
